Feynman Writing Prompts

For:
the "for" keyword signifies a type of loop or software code that runs over and over
until it returns what we are looking for. There are 3 main parts to a for loop statement.
First is to declare a variable, second is a conditional expression or statement that will
continue until it is false. Third is the incrementation of the variable. For loops usually
run until the conditional expression is false.

&& || and !:
These are called Logical Operators.

&& means AND...this will check if both expressions are true. If they are it will return
TRUE. If one of them is false it will return FALSE.

|| means OR....this will check if one of the expressions is true. If one or two expressions
are true then it will return TRUE. If both expressions are false then it will return FALSE.

! means NOT....it will return the opposite boolean value of what is passed to it.

Arrays:
These can be thought of as containers for a collection of several data types.
To create an Array you set a variable followed by []. You can then insert variables
separated by commas.  It can almost be unlimited amounts of variables and of any type.
